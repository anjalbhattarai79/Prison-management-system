## How to Cite These Sources

### For Problem Statement:
```
"Nepal's prison system faces severe challenges including overcrowding, with facilities 
operating at 150-200% capacity (Adhikari, 2019; Karki, 2020), and reliance on manual 
record-keeping that leads to inefficiencies and data integrity issues (Sharma & Thapa, 
2021)."

"The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (2019) identified critical deficiencies 
in Nepal's prison information management, including lack of centralized databases and 
systematic prisoner tracking mechanisms."
```

### For Solutions/Your System:
```
"Digital transformation of criminal justice records in developing countries like Nepal 
can significantly improve operational efficiency and data accuracy (Bhattarai & Koirala, 
2022). The implementation of data structures such as LinkedLists, Queues, and Stacks 
provides scalable solutions for prisoner management systems (Cormen et al., 2009)."

"Automated identification systems and efficient search algorithms address the critical 
need for rapid information retrieval in correctional facilities (Bhattarai & Poudel, 
2023; Sedgewick & Wayne, 2011)."
